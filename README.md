# CS61CPU

Look ma, I made a CPU! Here's what I did:


Setup: Logisim
This project is done in Logisim. In the the directory, run `bash test.sh download_tools` to download Venus and Logisim for this project. (You only need to run this once.)

For the rest of the project, to open Logisim, run `java -jar tools/logisim-evolution.jar `.
